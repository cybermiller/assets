## Stop Ads Extension privacy policy
- Stop Ads has no home server.
- Stop Ads doesn't embed any analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
- Stop Ads doesn't accept donations or any other form of financing.

The only time Stop Ads connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the "Filter lists" pane in the dashboard, Stop Ads will not connect to any remote server unless you click "Update now" and only if there are assets deemed "out of date."
